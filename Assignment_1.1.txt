**Data types questions**

1. What are tuples?
Ans:
    Tuples are a sequence data type with immutable values in Python. Commas separate the values in a tuple.

2. What does immutable mean and what three types of Python core data types are considered immutable?
Ans: 
    An immutable data type is a type of object which cannot be modified after its creation. Numbers, strings, and tuples in Python fall into this category. 
    Although you cannot modify an immutable object in place, you can always create a new one by running an expression.

3. What does sequence mean and which three types of data fall into this category?
Ans:
    A sequence data type is a collection of objects ordered by a specific position. In Python, Strings, lists, and tuples are the data types based on
    sequences. The Sequences share common sequence operations, such as indexing, concatenation, and slicing, but also have type-specific method calls.

4. Python is an interpreted language. Explain?
Ans:
    An interpreted language is any programming language that executes its statements line by line. Programs written in Python run directly from the 
    source code, with no intermediary compilation step.

5. What are Python Modules?
Ans:
    Files containing Python codes are referred to as Python Modules. This code can either be classes, functions, or variables and saves the programmer 
    time by providing the predefined functionalities when needed. It is a file with “.py” extension containing an executable code.

    Commonly used built modules are listed below:

    * os
    * sys
    * data time
    * math
    * random
    * JSON
    

**Operators**

1. How many operators in Python?
Ans:
    In Python, there are seven different types of operators:

    Arithmetic operators.
    Assignment operators.
    Comparison operators.
    Logical operators.
    Identity operators.
    Membership operators.
    Bitwise operators.


2. What is the '%' operator in Python?
Ans:
    Image result for interview questions on Operators in python
    The % symbol in Python is called the Modulo Operator. It returns the remainder of dividing the left hand operand by right hand operand. 
    It's used to get the remainder of a division problem.


3. What is the main function of Arithmetic operator?
Ans:
    Arithmetic Operators are used to perform mathematical calculations. Assignment Operators are used to assign a value to a 
    property or variable. Assignment Operators can be numeric, date, system, time, or text. Comparison Operators are used to perform comparisons.


4. Which Boolean operator has the highest priority?
Ans:
    The order of operations for Boolean algebra, from highest to lowest priority is NOT, then AND, then OR.


**Conditional Statements**

1. What is pass in Python?
Ans:
    Pass means, no-operation Python statement, or in other words it is a place holder in compound statement, where there should be a 
    blank left and nothing has to be written there.

2. What Does The Continue Do In Python? 
Ans:
    The continue is a jump statement in Python which moves the control to execute the next iteration in a loop leaving all the remaining instructions 
    in the block unexecuted. The continue statement is applicable for both the “while” and “for” loops.


3. When Should You Use The “Break” In Python? 
Ans:
    Python provides a break statement to exit from a loop. Whenever the break hits in the code, the control of the program immediately exits from the 
    body of the loop. The break statement in a nested loop causes the control to exit from the inner iterative block.


4. What Is The Difference Between Pass And Continue In Python? 
Ans:
    The continue statement makes the loop to resume from the next iteration.
    On the contrary, the pass statement instructs to do nothing, and the remainder of the code executes as usual.


**Looping Statements**

1. What Is A Built-In Function That Python Uses To Iterate Over A Number Sequence?
Ans:
    Range() generates a list of numbers, which is used to iterate over for loops.

    The range() function accompanies two sets of parameters.

    range(stop)
    stop: It is the no. of integers to generate and starts from zero. eg. range(3) == [0, 1, 2].
    range([start], stop[, step])
    Start: It is the starting no. of the sequence.
    Stop: It specifies the upper limit of the sequence.
    Step: It is the incrementing factor for generating the sequence.


2. How does For loop and While loop differ in Python and when do you choose to use them?
Ans:
    For loop is generally used to iterate through the elements of various collection types such as List, Tuple, Set, and Dictionary.

    While loop is the actual looping feature that is used in any other programming language. This is how Python differs in handling loops from the other programming languages.


**Functions**

1. What are functions in Python?
Ans:
    A function is a segment of code that runs only when it is called. The “def” keyword is utilized to define a specific function, as exemplified below:

    def my_function():
        print("Hi, Welcome to Intellipaat")
    my_function()  # call to the function

    Output:
    Hi, Welcome to Intellipaat

2. What is lambda in Python?
Ans:
    anonymous function means that a function is without a name. As we already know that def keyword is used to define the normal functions and the lambda 
    keyword is used to create anonymous functions.


3. Mention what are the rules for local and global variables in Python?
Ans:
    Local variables: If a variable is assigned a new value anywhere within the function's body, it's assumed to be local.
    Global variables: Those variables that are only referenced inside a function are implicitly global.


3. Mention the use of the split function in Python?
Ans:
    The use of the split function in Python is that it breaks a string into shorter strings using the defined separator. It gives a list of all 
    words present in the string.


4. What is *args and **kwargs?
Ans:
    *args is used when the programmer is not sure about how many arguments are going to be passed to a function, or if the programmer is 
    expecting a list or a tuple as argument to the function.

    **kwargs is used when a dictionary (keyword arguments) is expected as an argument to the function.
